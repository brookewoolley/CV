My passion is for creating useful, beautiful things.  This, plus a long-standing interest in tech, has led me to study at the [Makers](https://makers.tech/) software development bootcamp (January cohort). My background is in visual arts and like most creatives I am a self-starter, always with a project on the go.

I am looking for a role where I can continue to learn and challenge myself using the industry best practices Makers have instilled.

## Skills

#### Communication and team work

I make an excellent team member, able to champion and have empathy for others.  I have particularly enjoyed pair programming at Makers, finding it an extremely effective learning practice and way of quickly working through problems.  I would love to be able to continue to pair in my first developer role.

In my freelance life I have pitched regularly to clients, honing both my written and verbal communication skills. I have learnt that regular, effective communication is key to delivering a successful project, keeping everyone on-track and happy.  

#### Creative Design

I have spent most of my life practising art and design and therefore have a keen visual eye.  I have successfully worked to brief for clients countless times and am visually precise.  I specialised in architectural illustration, maps and event stationery.  You can see a selection of work here:- https://www.instagram.com/brookewoolleyillo/.   

Most of my creative skills are self-taught which has been a useful touchstone for learning to code as I feel that there are many parallels to the processes of creating a program as well as the need for continuous learning and maintaining a practice.

#### Problem Solving

During my time at Makers I have become an adept problem solver, having developed a robust process when approaching a project brief.  I am able to break down complex problems into smaller pieces using the many best-practice skills Makers teach.  I am a believer in TDD, enjoy debugging and, being a visual person, love a good diagram session before implementing any code.
