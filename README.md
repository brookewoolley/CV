## Brooke Woolley

I am about to kick start a career change by learning to code with Makers.  I have spent the past six months winding down my freelance work as an illustrator and designer in order to complete this highly selective course.  My passion is for creating useful, beautiful things and I have always desired a career where I could pursue this.  I am a self-starter with a DIY approach to life, who always has a project on the go. I would love a new challenge within a supportive team environment where I can continue to learn.

I am originally from New Zealand but have been living in London for the past 12 years.

## Skills

#### Development skills

TBC!

I have been creating my own websites from a young age (hello geocities!) and more recently building my business websites and portfolio. I'm very excited to see what i'm able to create once I have finished my 12 weeks at Makers (and beyond).

#### Creative Design

I have spent most of my life practising art and design and therefore have a keen visual eye.  I have successfully worked to brief for clients countless times and am visually precise.  Most of my creative skills are self-taught.
